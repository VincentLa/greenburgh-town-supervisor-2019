# School Budget Data
1. In the greenburgh_csd directory, I had downloaded the budget documents directly from https://www.greenburghcsd.org/Page/3176

2. However, I later found out that you can download all the school district data in a clean format as provided in https://www.osc.state.ny.us/localgov/datanstat/findata/index_choice.htm. This is what populates the schooldistrict_all_years directory
